   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=B-B1_001-E-F-415
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 4 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 1 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Severe  ** For zone: DEFAULT it is not possible to calculate the volume from the surrounding surfaces so either provide the volume value or define all the surfaces to fully enclose the zone.
   ** Warning ** Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0 for Zone=DEFAULT
   **   ~~~   ** The calculated Zone Volume was=0.00
   **   ~~~   ** The simulation will continue with the Zone Volume set to 10.0 m3. 
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 3 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are receiving surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual warnings for each surface.
   ** Severe  ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 5 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual severes for each surface.
