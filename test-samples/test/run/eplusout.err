   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** GetVertices: Roof/Ceiling is not oriented correctly! Tilt angle=[89.0], should be near 0, Surface="E-03S0_100-E-W-987", in Zone="DEFAULT".

   ** Severe  ** GetSurfaceData: Zone has no surfaces, Zone=ZONE
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: There are 10 coincident/collinear vertices; These have been deleted unless the deletion would bring the number of surface sides < 3.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each problem surface, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   **  Fatal  ** GetSurfaceData: Errors discovered, program terminates.
