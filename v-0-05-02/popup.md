There are many aspects to "fixing" gbXML files.

* There can be clerical errors such as typos, repeated data, dat in worong place
* There can be scheam disobediance errors such as external surfaces indicating two adjacent spaces
* There can be 3D errors such as a normal facing the wrong way
* There  can be insufficient information errors such as missing construction, layer and material data

Currently, the fixing code is split up between Viewer and Fixer

Your advice and suggestions for building a process that helps you with your workflow is very much appreciated.
